By starting the timer at the start of the game, you can check the opening time of the down gate in the ruin.

## Warning

1. This may violate the game's terms of service. Use at your own risk.
2. All numbers are found by self-research and may be wrong or useless.
   - Don't worry about the few seconds difference.
3. Works on my machine (TM) with 1440p display, so it may not work on yours. Adjust some UI as needed.

## Usage

Just press `Control + Shift + W` when the game starts...

## Stack

- Tauri + Vanilla TS
  - Of course Rust doesn't do anything for this
